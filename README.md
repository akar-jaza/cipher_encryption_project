# Cipher Encryption

A simple Flutter project for system security that demonstrates text encoding using a cipher algorithm. The project is built as part of a System Security lecture and focuses on encrypting text based on user input, allowing users to encode messages securely.

## Features

- Text input field for entering plaintext.
- Text input field for entering the alphabet (default is the English alphabet).
- Input for specifying a shift value for encoding.
- Displays the encoded result in a modal bottom sheet.

## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:
